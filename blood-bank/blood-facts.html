          Human blood is an incredibly important fluid. Without this fluid, no
          human can survive. One of the most important functions of blood is to
          carry oxygen to different parts of the body. In absence of blood, body
          will fail to receive any oxygen which will result in death. But is
          that the only function of blood? Not really! There are other important
          functions too. Let us learn 80 interesting human blood facts in order
          to find out some really amazing facts about this fascinating body
          fluid. We are sure, you will be surprised! Are you ready?
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>1. Nearly 7% of the body weight of a human is made up of blood.</p>
          <p>
            2. Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are present in
            blood.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Blood consists of a yellow liquid which is known as blood plasma.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Blood plasma is primarily made up of water. 90% of blood plasma
            is water.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Blood plasma also consists of hormones, glucose, proteins, gases,
            electrolytes and nutrients.
          </p>

          <p>
            6. Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are all found
            floating in blood plasma.
          </p>

          <p>
            7. Blood plasma can be separated using centrifuge device which spins
            blood at a very high speed. The cells then get collected at the
            bottom of the tube, separating blood plasma from the cells.
          </p>

          <p>
            . Only the red blood cells in our blood are responsible for carrying
            oxygen.
          </p>

          <p>
            9. Red blood cells consist of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is actually a
            protein that contains iron. Oxygen combines with this iron and gives
            the characteristic red color to our blood as well as hemoglobin.
          </p>

          <p>
            10. Unlike red blood cells, the white blood cells in our blood form
            the defensive system of our body. These white blood cells are
            responsible for fighting viruses, bacteria and other infectious
            diseases. They also fight cancer cells and other unwanted material
            that enter human body.
          </p>

          <p>
            11. Platelets are completely different and are responsible for blood
            clotting whenever bleeding occurs because of a cut or bruise. This
            prevents unwanted loss of blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            12. While blood clotting is meant for good, it can become dangerous.
            If blood clots in blood vessels of heart, one can experience heart
            attack. Similarly, blood clot in brain can lead to stroke.
          </p>

          <p>
            13. Blood is not just responsible for carrying oxygen to different
            parts of the body. It also carries nutrients to body cells. At the
            same time, it also carries away unwanted waste material away from
            the cells.
          </p>

          <p>
            14. Blood pressure is actually the pressure exerted by blood on
            blood vessel walls. BP is a vital sign of life.
          </p>

          <p>15. High BP implies increased risk of stroke and heart attack.</p>

          <p>
            16. Average blood pressure will always vary from one person to
            another despite the fact that standard considered BP is 112/64 mmHg.
          </p>

          <p>
            17. Though we are familiar with common blood types A, B, AB and O,
            which is a part of simplified ABO system, there are actually around
            30 different recognized blood groups or blood types.
          </p>

          <p>
            18. An adult body has 100,000 kilometers or 60,000 miles of blood
            vessels running throughout the body.
          </p>

          <p>
            19. The average volume of blood present in an adult male body is 5.6
            liters while an adult female body contains 4.5 liters of blood on an
            average.
          </p>

          <p>
            20. A new born baby will have around 1 cup of blood in its body.
          </p>

          <p>
            21. Blood plasma we mentioned earlier makes up around 55% of the
            total volume of blood present in human body.
          </p>

          <p>
            22. Blood consists of a special type of white blood cell known as
            granulocyte. These cells roll along blood vessel walls and hunt for
            bacteria. If they find any harmful bacteria, granulocytes will
            destroy these bacteria by engulfing them.
          </p>

          <p>
            23. Red blood cells survive in circulatory system for no more than
            120 days.
          </p>

          <p>
            24. Platelets, plasma and red blood cells are constantly produced by
            bone marrow.
          </p>

          <p>

            27. Donated blood plasma can be stored for 1 year in frozen
            condition.
          </p>

          <p>
            28. Platelets, red blood cells and blood plasma can be separately
            donated instead of donating blood as a whole. This type of donation
            is known as Apheresis.
          </p>

          <p>
            29. Humans can have artificial heart but there is absolutely no
            substitute for human blood. There is no such thing called artificial
            blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            30. Our body has about 0.2 mg of gold. Most of this gold is actually
            in our blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            31. We find pus kind of disgusting but it is actually nothing but
            white blood cells that died while defending our body against
            infections.
          </p>

          <p>
            32. The only place where blood cannot be found in human body is the
            cornea (eye) because cornea is capable of directly extracting oxygen
            from air.
          </p>

          <p>
            33. Supply of blood in blood vessels located in nose increases when
            someone catches cold. This happens to keep the nose warm. As a
            result of this blood vessels dilate and increase mucus production
            and leads to runny nose.
          </p>

          <p>
            34. Scientists have come up with a method that can be used to send
            oxygen directly to blood without using the lungs.
          </p>

          <p>
            35. Mosquitoes have an uncanny preference to the blood type they
            suck. They prefer blood group O more than other blood groups.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            38. Nearly 1/4th of total cells in human body are red blood cells.
            So, the total number of red blood cells in an adult human body at
            any given point in time is around 20-30 trillion. The total number
            of white blood cells in an adult human body is between 4,000 and
            11,000. Please remember that these numbers are just best estimates
            based on size and volume of the cells in comparison to total mass of
            an adult human body.
          </p>

          <p>
            39. Nearly 2 million red blood cells in an adult human body die

          </p>

          <p>
            41. Our heart pumps 1.5 million barrels of blood during our entire
            lifetime. This is enough blood to completely fill 200 tank cars of
            train.
          </p>

          <p>42. Every two seconds, someone in this world will need blood.</p>

          <p>
            43. The donated blood is actually sold on market collecting 4.5
            billion US dollars a year! That’s a huge industry.
          </p>

          <p>44. Donating blood never reduces a person’s physical energy.</p>

          <p>
            45. The amount of fluid lost when donating blood is actually
            replaced by our body within a few hours.

          <p>
            47. It takes up to 8 weeks to replace the amount of iron lost after
            blood donation. This is precisely why a person is not allowed to
            donate blood twice within 8 weeks.
          </p>

          <p>
            48. On an average, an adult human body (not considering whether male

            antigen that was capable of curing Rhesus disease. Till date,
            Harrison has donated blood 1,000 times and is responsible for curing

          </p>

          <p>
            62. Bayer pharmaceutics is possibly one of the most unethical
            companies in this world. The company once sold blood products that
            were contaminated with Hepatitis C and HIV. By the time the company
            learned that the product was contaminated, 10,000 people in US had
            already contracted HIV. The company did withdraw the products from

            64. Saddam Hussein, during the late 90s, commissioned some people to
            write a Quran using his blood. The Quran was written but it remains
            a paradox for Muslim leaders. A Quran cannot be written using blood
            because it is a sin in Islam but the Quran cannot be destroyed
            either because that too is a sin. That Quran exists but no one knows

          </p>

          <p>
            65. There is a type of fatal blood disease whose only cure is to
            donate blood. The disease is known as hemochromatosis, which is

            causing toxic iron buildup in organs.
          </p>

          <p>
            66. George Washington was killed by his doctors. He was actually
            bled to death. Doctors used the then popular practice of
            bloodletting to cure his sore throat problem. It was nothing but a
            method of removing dirty blood. By the time bloodletting treatment
            was finished, more than half of total blood in Washington’s body had
            been removed which turned out to be fatal.
          </p>

          <p>
            67. Blood type is an indicator of a person’s personality – this is
            what Japanese people believe. Thus, Japanese market is flood with
            good themed after blood types. Products like books, drinks, condoms
            etc. with blood-type theme are sold in Japan.
          </p>

          <p>

            Egyptian avoided drinking wine.
          </p>

          <p>
            71. Every year, around 1.3 million pints or units of donated blood
            is wasted because the shelf life of blood is 42 days.
          </p>

          <p>
            72. Kidneys are actually responsible for regulating the production
            of red blood cells in human body. Kidneys are responsible for
            producing erythropoietin hormone (EPO) that binds with the receptors
            in stem cell walls in bone marrow and after a complex set of events,
            the DNA of stem cells are transformed into red blood cells.

            73. Kidneys will release EPO only when it finds that oxygen levels
            in blood have gone below normal. In other words, kidneys are
            responsible for measuring levels of oxygen in blood.

            74. People suffering with kidney failure generally become anemic
            because kidneys fail to produce enough EPO that can stimulate the
            production of red blood cells in bone marrow. This however never
            means that all anemic patients have failed kidneys.

            75. The first ever successful blood transfusion was not between
            humans but between dogs and this event took place somewhere in
            1660s.

            78. The circumference of earth is 40,000 kilometers or 25,000 miles.
            If all blood vessels in a human body are placed end to end, they can
            wrap around our earth nearly 2.5 times!

            79. Red blood cells are special cells in our body. They do not have
            nuclei. Because there is no nucleus in a red blood cell, it cannot
            multiply through cell division because for a cell to undergo cell
            division, a nucleus is necessary. Thus, red blood cells simply die
            out after 120 days.
