                You must be at least 17 years old to donate to the general blood
                supply, or 16 years old with parental/guardian consent, if
                allowed by state law. There is no upper age limit for blood

              <p>
                Those younger than age 17 are almost always legal minors (not
                yet of the age of majority) who cannot give consent by
                themselves to donate blood. (Each state determines its own age
                of majority, which can be different for different activities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Persons under the age of 17 may, however, donate blood for their
                own use, in advance of scheduled surgery or in situations where
                their blood has special medical value for a particular patient
                such as a family member.

                If you have a history of bleeding problems, you will be asked
                additional questions. If your blood does not clot normally, you
                should not donate since you may have excessive bleeding where
                the needle was placed. For the same reason, you should not
                donate if you are taking any "blood thinner" such as:
              </p>

                If you are on aspirin, it is OK to donate whole blood. However,
                you must be off of aspirin for at least 2 full days in order to
                donate platelets by apheresis. For example, if you take aspirin
                products on Monday, the soonest you may donate platelets is
                Thursday. Donors with clotting disorder from Factor V who are
                not on anticoagulants are eligible to donate; however, all
                others must be evaluated by the health historian at the
                collection center.

                Eligibility depends on the type of cancer and treatment history.
                If you had leukemia or lymphoma, including Hodgkin’s Disease and
                other cancers of the blood, you are not eligible to donate.
                Other types of cancer are acceptable if the cancer has been
                treated successfully and it has been more than 12 months since
                treatment was completed and there has been no cancer recurrence
                in this time. Lower risk in-situ cancers including squamous or
                basal cell cancers of the skin that have been completely removed
                and healed do not require a 12-month waiting period.

                the health historian at the time of donation.
